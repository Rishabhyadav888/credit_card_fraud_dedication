        "The project aimed to predict the probability of default for Taiwanese credit card clients to minimize losses for banks and credit card companies. The classification problem involved predicting if a client would default or not in the next month. The study highlighted the importance of risk management and demonstrated how machine learning algorithms can improve predictive accuracy.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the data preprocessing step, the ID column was dropped, and the numeric columns were converted to the integer data type. The values of the categorical columns were also changed from integer to string data type for better understanding. Some columns were renamed to make them more meaningful. Additionally, a new feature called \"total due\" was added, which represented the total amount left for payment. These steps were taken to improve the quality and usability of the data for machine learning analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the data visualization step, univariate analysis, bivariate analysis, and multivariate analysis were performed to understand the relationships between variables. The correlation heatmap showed that bill months had multicollinearity with VIF values greater than 20. To address this issue, the columns were added together, and a new column called \"total bill\" was created. This step helped to improve the accuracy of the machine learning algorithm by reducing the impact of multicollinearity on the analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the feature engineering step, category encoding was performed on several categorical columns. For sex, level encoding was used, and for marriage and education, one-hot encoding was used. In the feature selection step, recursive feature selection was employed, which involved the backward elimination of features based on their coefficient values by running different combinations. The data scaling was performed using the standard scalar. To handle the imbalanced data of the dependent variable, the SMOTE oversampling method was used. Finally, the data was split into training and testing sets using the train-test split method. These steps were taken to improve the quality of the data and prepare it for machine learning analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the ML model implementation step, various algorithms were used to build the predictive model, including logistic regression, decision tree, K-nearest neighbor classifier, random forest, and XGBoost classifier. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy score, ROC-AUC score, and confusion matrix were used to assess the performance of the models. These metrics helped to determine the accuracy and reliability of the model and were used to select the best performing model for the final analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "Identifying credit card transactions that are likely to default on payment is crucial for businesses to minimize financial losses, protect their credit score, avoid legal issues, and maintain a good reputation. This type of problem requires minimizing false negatives to accurately identify transactions that are likely to default. The K-nearest neighbor classifier had the highest recall score of 0.92, indicating that it is the most suitable model for predicting credit card defaults. Therefore, it can be used for the final prediction to help businesses prevent financial losses and minimize risk.\n",
        "\n",
        "In conclusion, the project demonstrated the importance of risk management and how machine learning algorithms can be used to improve predictive accuracy for credit card default prediction in Taiwan. Through various steps of data preprocessing, visualization, feature engineering, selection, and ML model implementation, the project aimed to prepare the data for analysis and select the best performing model for the final prediction. The K-nearest neighbor classifier had the highest recall score, indicating its suitability for predicting credit card defaults, and can be used to help businesses minimize financial losses and risk."
